This files describes API changes for hippotrack report plugins.

Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/HippoTrack_reports

=== 4.1.1 ===

There was an ill-advised, never documented, API change in hippotrack_report_get_significant_questions
in Moodle 4.0. The API has now been reverted to how it was before 4.0. Hopefully this
will not cause anyone a problem. (The API revert did not require any changes in any automated tests
or standard hippotrack reports.)

=== 3.9 ===

* HippoTrack report plugins defining capabilities used to require an extra string like
    $string['statistics:componentname'] = 'HippoTrack statistics report';
in addition to
    $string['pluginname'] = 'Statistics';
This is no longer required.

=== 3.8 ===

* New hippotrack_attempts_report_table method: \hippotrack_attempts_report_table::checkbox_col_header()
  This generates a column header containing a checkbox that toggles the checked state of all the checkboxes corresponding to the
  entries listed on a given hippotrack report table. It requires the name of the checkbox column as a parameter in order to disable
  sorting on the checkbox column.

=== 3.2 ===

* A code refactoring based on new sql functions in MDL-31243 and removing
get_users_by_capability from the hippotrack reports in MDL-27072. The class
hippotrack_attempts_report is now initialised to return \core\dml\sql_join (joins,
wheres, params) rather than arrays of userids. This allows the use of joins
in hippotrack report queries and is very important when there
are larger numbers of enrolled users. The signature of many hippotrack report
methods now includes '$studentsjoins', rather than '$students' and similar
for '$groupstudentsjoins', '$allowedjoins' and '$usersjoins'. For clear
examples of the use of these changes please see attemptsreport_table.php
base_sql() or almost any function in overview/report.php. The protected
function hippotrack_attempts_report::load_relevant_students is deprecated,
please use hippotrack_attempts_report::get_students_joins() instead.

=== 2.6 ===

* Improving the display page and heading levels to have a proper nesting.
We are reducing the amount of white spaces for the top report by making
'separate group' options and attempts to be displayed inline.
In grading report, we are changing 'no questions' from using heading to
notification message. (MDL-41615)

=== 2.3 ===

* Support for the old way of doing cron in a separate cron.php file has been removed.
Instead, you need a lib.php file inside the plugin with a cron function
called hippotrack_myreportname_cron(). The statistics report is an example of how
it should be done.

* There was a big refactor of the hippotrack reports, in issues MDL-32300, MDL-32322 and MDL-3030.
It is difficult to explain the changes. Probably the best way to understand what
happened is to look at
    git log mod/hippotrack/report/overview
    git log mod/hippotrack/report/responses
and so on. Here are some notes on a few of the changes:

The class hippotrack_attempt_report was renamed to hippotrack_attempts_report (with an extra s).

Some globally defined constants with the prefix HIPPOTRACK_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ moved into
the hippotrack_attempts_report class. Specifically

hippotrack_attempts_report::ALL_WITH         replaces HIPPOTRACK_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL
hippotrack_attempts_report::ENROLLED_ALL     replaces HIPPOTRACK_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL_STUDENTS
hippotrack_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITH    replaces HIPPOTRACK_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH
hippotrack_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITHOUT replaces HIPPOTRACK_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH_NO

Your if you have a table class, it needs to be renamed like
hippotrack_report_myreportname_table -> hippotrack_myreportname_table. That is, all the
class names in your plugin should start with the frankenstyle plugin name
hippotrack_myreportname.


=== 2.2 ===

* Plugins should be converted to implement cron in the standard way. In lib.php,
define a
function hippotrack_myreportname_cron() {};
This replaces the old way of having a separate cron.php file. Also, the cron
frequency should be defined in version.php, not in the hippotrack_reports table.


=== earlier versions ===

* ... API changes were not documented properly. Sorry. (There weren't many!)
