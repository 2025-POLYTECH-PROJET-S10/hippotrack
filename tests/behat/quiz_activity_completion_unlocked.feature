  Scenario: Student will receive correct completion even when teacher unlocked completion and re-grading.
    Given I am on the "Test hippotrack name" "hippotrack activity" page logged in as student1
    And the "Receive a grade" completion condition of "Test hippotrack name" is displayed as "todo"
    And the "Receive a passing grade" completion condition of "Test hippotrack name" is displayed as "todo"
    And user "student1" has attempted "Test hippotrack name" with responses:
      | slot | response |
      | 1    | True     |
      | 2    | False    |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test hippotrack name"
    And the "Receive a grade" completion condition of "Test hippotrack name" is displayed as "done"
    And the "Receive a passing grade" completion condition of "Test hippotrack name" is displayed as "done"
    And I log out
    When I am on the "Course 1" course page logged in as teacher1
    And I navigate to "Reports > Activity completion" in current page administration
    And "Completed (achieved pass grade)" "icon" should exist in the "Student 1" "table_row"
    And I am on the "Test hippotrack name" "hippotrack activity" page
    And I navigate to "Settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I press "Unlock completion settings"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | gradepass | 10 |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I navigate to "Reports > Activity completion" in current page administration
    Then "Completed (achieved pass grade)" "icon" should not exist in the "Student 1" "table_row"
    And I log out
    And I am on the "Test hippotrack name" "hippotrack activity" page logged in as student1
    And the "Receive a grade" completion condition of "Test hippotrack name" is displayed as "done"
    And the "Receive a passing grade" completion condition of "Test hippotrack name" is displayed as "failed"
