Feature: HippoTrack reset
  In order to reuse past hippotrackzes
  As a teacher
  I need to remove all previous data.

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Terry1    | Teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Sam1      | Student1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:

      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |

    And hippotrack "Test hippotrack name" contains the following questions:
      | question | page |
      | TF1      | 1    |
    And user "student1" has attempted "Test hippotrack name" with responses:
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | True     |

  Scenario: Use course reset to clear all attempt data

    And I set the following fields to these values:
        | Delete all hippotrack attempts | 1 |
    And I press "Reset course"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I am on the "Test hippotrack name" "mod_hippotrack > Grades report" page
    Then I should see "Attempts: 0"

  Scenario: Use course reset to remove user overrides.
    Given the following "mod_hippotrack > user overrides" exist:
      | hippotrack           | user     | attempts |
      | Test hippotrack name | student1 | 2        |
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the "Course 1" "reset" page
    And I set the field "Delete all user overrides" to "1"
    And I press "Reset course"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I am on the "Test hippotrack name" "mod_hippotrack > User overrides" page
    Then I should not see "Sam1 Student1"

      | hippotrack           | group | attempts |
      | Test hippotrack name | G1    | 2        |
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the "Course 1" "reset" page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
        | Delete all group overrides | 1 |
    And I press "Reset course"
